BUILD Focus Area

The claim about construction cost is being checked by checking the cost of all columns in the building

The claim is found in section 6 in the PM report, cost estimate, specifically page 6 in the PM Appendix

The script calculates the total volume of all concrete columns in the structural model, and then multiplies the average unit cost of the columns with the total volume, for the total cost of all columns
