BUILD Focus Area

Part of the claim about the construction cost is being checked, by checking the cost of all columns in building #2406.

The claim is found in section 6 in the PM report, cost estimate, specifically page 6 in the PM Appendix where information about each construction element is found.

The script calculates the total volume of all concrete columns in the structural model, and then multiplies the average unit cost of the columns with the total volume, for the total cost of all columns.

The script is ColumnVolumesAndCost
