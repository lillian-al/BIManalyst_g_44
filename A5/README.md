#### Summary or tutorial feedback
  Based on the feedback that we received on [our tool ](https://github.com/lillian-al/BIManalyst_g_44/blob/main/A3/README.md)from other groups we could confirm that the tool effectively addressed the identified use case, which is extracting and calculating volumes of columns in an IFC file. The script demonstrated the capability to access and utilize property data stored in the IFC model, achieving the intended goal. The feedback also confirmed that the methodology was clear, adaptable, and solved real challenges.

One question that we received from a group was whether the volume of columns was based on the dimensions. The answer to that was that the volume is based on the values stored in the IFC file, and not recalculated from dimensions. This question highlighted the importance of clarifying how the volume is derived and indicates a need to elaborate on how IFC files store data, which could enhance the tutorial's explanation. 

Other comments that we received were that we made a great phase breakdown and that it was cool that the tutorial is interchangeable and could be used for beams or other elements. The tutorial’s step-by-step structure and adaptability to other elements were appreciated. This validates the methodical approach and highlights its broader applicability. The acknowledgment of the tutorial's adaptability suggests it could be expanded to show examples for beams, walls, or other elements, further showcasing the tool's versatility.

#### Process of the tutorial
When developing [our tutorial](https://github.com/lillian-al/BIManalyst_g_44/blob/main/A4/README.md) we approached the process as follows:
1. **Identify Key Concepts**: We focused on extracting and calculating column volumes, based on our tool in A3.  
2. **Outline Steps**: We broke down the process into logical parts: setting up the environment, loading the IFC file, retrieving column data, accessing properties, and calculating volumes.  
3. **Create the Content**: We detailed each step with explanations, code snippets, and outputs for clarity.  
4. **Test & Refine**: We ran the tutorial step-by-step, ensuring it was accurate and easy to follow.  
5. **Present & Review**: We shared it with peers, incorporated feedback, and adjusted any unclear parts.

The process of the course helped us gain a deeper understanding of OpenBIM concepts and tools. OpenBIM could definitely be applied in automating workflows, which could be relevant to future research or practical applications.

We appreciated the freedom in choosing use cases in the course, as it allowed us to focus on topics relevant to our interests. However clearer examples could have made the initial steps easier.

The number of tools in the course was adequate. Adding too many could overwhelm beginners, while removing essential tools like ifcopenshell or visualization libraries would limit the learning experience. The balance felt just right, however introducing a visual debugging tool for IFC data could be helpful.

  #### My learning experience for the concept I focused on
At the beginning of this course I had a basic understanding of BIM concepts but limited experience with OpenBIM tools such as ifcopenshell. My knowledge of IFC files was theoretical, with minimal exposure to practical coding or property extraction workflows. I would say that I was a beginner analyst, but have now moved up to a self learner. Throughout the course I have gained practical proficiency in using OpenBIM tools like ifcopenshell for specific tasks such as accessing and analyzing IFC files. I have now gained skills in extracting data programmatically, and understanding their structure through tools like ifcopenshell. I also gained an appreciation for the potential of OpenBIM to enhance collaboration and transparency in projects.

Despite my progress, there are areas where I need further growth. So far, my experience has primarily focused on extracting properties of a single element type, such as columns. To advance my skills, I aim to perform more complex analyses that involve entire buildings. This could include evaluating structural systems, performing energy simulations, or calculating material quantities across multiple elements. Additionally, I want to deepen my understanding of advanced OpenBIM workflows, such as integrating multiple IFC files, automating repetitive tasks, and enhancing data visualization for better communication of results.

In the future, I see OpenBIM playing a important role in my work. Its ability to manage building information make it ideal for collaborative design and construction projects. I plan to use OpenBIM for tasks like structural analysis, cost estimation, and lifecycle assessment. For example, extracting and analyzing detailed material properties could inform decisions about sustainability and resource efficiency. Furthermore, OpenBIM can support innovative approaches, such as using automated compliance checks to ensure building designs meet regulatory and project-specific standards. This versatility makes OpenBIM an essential tool for advancing both my professional and academic pursuits.

#### My future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
I don't think I will use OpenBIM tools directly in my thesis, however the foundational understanding that I have gained can inform certain aspects, particularly if I explore automating workflows or data management in the built environment.

On the other side, it is highly likely that I will use OpenBIM tools in my professional life. With the growing emphasis on collaboration and interoperability in the construction industry, OpenBIM tools will play a key role in streamlining processes, improving efficiency, and enhancing project outcomes.

#### Wrap up
Reflecting on my journey through the assignments, I have developed a significantly deeper understanding of OpenBIM tools and their application. Each assignment was an opportunity to build on the skills introduced in the previous one.

Starting with assignment A1, I was introduced to the process of validating claims made in project reports using OpenBIM tools. A1 provided a foundational understanding of how IFC files and scripting can be used to extract meaningful data.
In A2 I learned more about use cases and was able to identify a specific use case relevant to my focus area and map out how OpenBIM could address it.
A3 was the core technical challenge, where I developed a Python script to address the use case defined in A2. The tool automated the extraction of IFC element properties, providing a structured approach to analyzing model data. This assignment significantly improved my coding skills.
In A4, Mahdi and I got to create and present a tutorial that addressed a learning need within the group. I found this to be a great way to conclude after scripting in A3, as it allowed us to solve any challenges we had faced during the development process. The tutorials I developed and reviewed helped reinforce my knowledge and clarified advanced concepts.
Finally, A5 provided an opportunity to reflect on the entire learning experience and consider how these tools and techniques might influence my academic and professional future.

This process has been a valuable learning journey and the course has overall equipped me with a strong foundation for exploring advanced applications of OpenBIM.

#### My learning experience:

  At the start of the course, I was a **Modeler**, but by the end I happily consider myself a **self-learner** in OpenBIM. While I know there's still a lot to master both in terms of BIM tools and programming skills on Python, this course helped me to establish a stronger plan. Thanks to Moussa, our manager, I learned fast how to tackle mistakes while coding. At the beginning of the course, my Python knowledge was quite limited, but that didn’t hold me back. Now I’ve developed my coding skills and gained the confidence to keep learning and growing in this area. The journey with Python has just begun, and I’m excited to see where I can go with it! 
  
During the course, Lilian and I tackeld a concrete challenge, our mission was to develop a tool that could verify the accuracy of construction cost estimates for all the concrete columns in the Building #2406 case. The result for me was a deeper appreciation for OpenBIM as a main tool shaping the future of the construction field.   

With my current knowledge in Revit, this experience added to my ambition to look deeper into Python and OpenBIM. My (current) final goal is to step into the role of a construction manager equipped with the skills to use these tools and supercharge construction management efficiency! I plan to become a BIM manager in the near future, using these skills to grow into a more independent and efficient construction manager.

#### A small Idea, but maybe useful

Although I’m still unsure about incorporating OpenBIM into my thesis, I had an idea while searching for its benefits. While searching for data on the advantages of hiring OpenBIM experts, I found a surprising lack of statistics. This gap inspired me to consider exploring the impact of OpenBIM knowledge in companies, comparing those with engineers educated in OpenBIM to those without. I’d analyze their performance, future potentials, and economic benefits.  

As someone aspiring to be a construction manager, I’m convinced that OpenBIM is a gem to help me outperform others and grow into a more skilled professional. Without a doubt, I’ll continue learning and using BIM over the next decade.


#### Wrap up

Working through the assignments has been a rewarding experience for me that deepened my understanding of this technology and its applications. 

In [**A1**](https://github.com/lillian-al/BIManalyst_g_44/blob/main/A1/README.md), we started by verifying the construction cost of concrete columns in Building #2406. Using Python and ifcOpenShell, we calculated column volumes and costs, which gave us our first hands-on experience with OpenBIM and its ability to ensure cost accuracy in construction projects.  

[**A2**](https://github.com/lillian-al/BIManalyst_g_44/blob/main/A2/README.md) focused on defining a specific use case: verifying the accuracy of cost estimates for columns. We mapped out how to gather geometric data from the IFC file, classify columns by size, and calculate their costs. This step showed us how OpenBIM tools can simplify complex workflows and ensure financial integrity.  

[**A3**](https://github.com/lillian-al/BIManalyst_g_44/blob/main/A3/README.md) was where it all came together. We built a Python tool to automate the process outlined in A2. The tool extracted column data, calculated volumes, applied unit costs, and validated the project’s cost estimates. It was challenging but rewarding to see how coding and OpenBIM work hand-in-hand to improve efficiency.  

In [**A4**](https://github.com/lillian-al/BIManalyst_g_44/blob/main/A4/README.md), we created a tutorial to guide others in extracting and analyzing IFC data. This was a great way to review everything we’d learned and make it accessible for others. Breaking down the steps into a clear guide helped us solidify our knowledge while helping the group tackle similar challenges.  

Finally, **A5** gave us a chance to reflect on everything we’d learned. Starting from basic data extraction to building tools and teaching others, we’ve come a long way. OpenBIM is more than just technology; it’s a powerful way to bring transparency and accuracy to construction projects, and we’re excited to use these skills in the future.
