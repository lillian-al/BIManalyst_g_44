## Summary of tutorial feedback
Based on the feedback that we received on our tool from other groups we could confirm that the tool effectively addressed the identified use case, which is extracting and calculating volumes of columns in an IFC file. The script demonstrated the capability to access and utilize property data stored in the IFC model, achieving the intended goal. The feedback also confirmed that the methodology was clear, adaptable, and solved real challenges.

One question that we received from a group was whether the volume of columns was based on the dimensions. The answer to that was that the volume is based on the values stored in the IFC file, and not recalculated from dimensions. This question highlighted the importance of clarifying how the volume is derived and indicates a need to elaborate on how IFC files store data, which could enhance the tutorial's explanation. 

Other comments that we received were that we made a great phase breakdown and that it was cool that the tutorial is interchangeable and could be used for beams or other elements. The tutorialâ€™s step-by-step structure and adaptability to other elements were appreciated. This validates the methodical approach and highlights its broader applicability. The acknowledgment of the tutorial's adaptability suggests it could be expanded to show examples for beams, walls, or other elements, further showcasing the tool's versatility.

## Lillian's reflection
At the beginning of this course, my understanding of OpenBIM was basic. I knew it involved interoperable workflows and formats like IFC, but I lacked practical knowledge of how to implement it effectively.
By the end of this course, I had developed significant skills in working with IFC files, extracting data programmatically, and understanding their structure through tools like ifcopenshell. I also gained an appreciation for the potential of OpenBIM to enhance collaboration and transparency in projects.
