# Reflect
## Summary of tutorial feedback
Based on the feedback that we received from other groups on our tool we could confirm that the tool effectively addressed the identified use case, which is extracting and calculating volumes of columns in an IFC file. The script demonstrated the capability to access and utilize property data stored in the IFC model, achieving the intended goal. The feedback also confirmed that the methodology was clear, adaptable, and solved real challenges.
