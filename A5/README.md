## Summary of tutorial feedback
Based on the feedback that we received on our tool from other groups we could confirm that the tool effectively addressed the identified use case, which is extracting and calculating volumes of columns in an IFC file. The script demonstrated the capability to access and utilize property data stored in the IFC model, achieving the intended goal. The feedback also confirmed that the methodology was clear, adaptable, and solved real challenges.

One question that we received from a group was whether the volume of columns was based on the dimensions. The answer to that was that the volume is based on the values stored in the IFC file, and not recalculated from dimensions. This question highlighted the importance of clarifying how the volume is derived and indicates a need to elaborate on how IFC files store data, which could enhance the tutorial's explanation. 

Other comments that we received were that we made a great phase breakdown and that it was cool that the tutorial is interchangeable and could be used for beams or other elements. The tutorialâ€™s step-by-step structure and adaptability to other elements were appreciated. This validates the methodical approach and highlights its broader applicability. The acknowledgment of the tutorial's adaptability suggests it could be expanded to show examples for beams, walls, or other elements, further showcasing the tool's versatility.

## Lillian's reflection
#### My learning experience for the concept I focused on
At the beginning of this course I had a basic understanding of BIM concepts but limited experience with OpenBIM tools such as ifcopenshell. My knowledge of IFC files was theoretical, with minimal exposure to practical coding or property extraction workflows. I would say that I was a beginner analyst, but have now moved up to a self learner. Throughout the course I have gained practical proficiency in using OpenBIM tools like ifcopenshell for specific tasks such as accessing and analyzing IFC files. I have now gained skills in extracting data programmatically, and understanding their structure through tools like ifcopenshell. I also gained an appreciation for the potential of OpenBIM to enhance collaboration and transparency in projects.

Despite my progress, there are areas where I need further growth.

## Mahdi's reflection
During this course, Lilian and I tackeld a concrete challenge! Our mission was to develop a tool that could verify the accuracy of construction cost estimates for all the concrete columns in the Building #2406 case. The result for me was a deeper appreciation for OpenBIM as a main tool shaping the future of the construction field.   

With my knowledge in Revit, this experience added to my ambition to look deeper into Python and OpenBIM. My (current) final goal is to step into the role of a construction manager equipped with the skills to use these tools and supercharge construction management efficiency!
