This verification focuses on the construction cost in Building #2406 as presented in the project management report. Specifically, the construction cost associated with all columns in the building will be checked. The information about the columns is found on page 6 in PM Appendix, where detailed descriptions of each construction element are provided.
The claim involves calculating the total cost for all concrete columns by deriving the cost from the volume of concrete used for these columns and multiplying it by the average unit cost. While the PM appendix specifies distinct unit costs for small and large columns, the dimensions of these columns do not match consistently across the structural model. Therefore, to maintain a coherent calculation, the average unit price is used for all columns.
By checking this claim, we aim to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the construction cost estimates related to structural elements. This verification will contribute to maintaining overall financial integrity in the project and ensure that cost management practices are appropriately followed.

This claim will be checked by extracting data from the IFC file, using the average unit cost, calculating the total cost, and comparing the total cost with the documentation in the report.
This claim needs to be checked when the structural model is developed but before finalizing the budget or construction contracts. This ensures that any discrepancies can be addressed prior to committing resources.
This claim relies on the following information:
1.	Geometric and material information from the IFC file
2.	Standard costs of square meters of columns based on Molio.dk
3.	Total volume/square meters of the columns
This claim is relevant during the design phase as it involves assessing construction cost based on the design elements in the structural model.
The first BIM purpose required is gathering. This refers to extracting relevant data from the IFC file, which includes the geometric and material information about all concrete columns. Secondly, the BIM purpose analyzing is required. This involves calculating the total volume of concrete columns and using the average unit cost to derive the total construction cost, allowing for an assessment of accuracy in the financial estimates
The closest BIM use case is Penn Stateâ€™s BIM use case under Plan: Cost analysis, Bill of quantities, 02: Cost Estimation. This use case focuses on using BIM for precise quantity take-offs and cost estimation throughout a project's lifecycle, which aligns with our task of calculating the total cost of columns by extracting volumes from the model and multiplying them by unit prices. It enables accurate material quantification, faster cost analysis, and helps in decision-making during the design stage.
