# Extracting IFC Element Properties: A Guide to Accessing Column Volumes with ifcopenshell
### **Summary**
Learn how to use ifcopenshell to extract and calculate the total volume of columns from an IFC file. This guide covers loading models, retrieving elements, and analyzing their properties for BIM and construction insights.


### **Overview**

In this tutorial, we'll cover how to use `ifcopenshell` to access element properties in an IFC file. Specifically, we’ll focus on extracting and calculating the total volume of columns in a building model. This guide is valuable for anyone looking to analyze IFC files for design, estimation, or building information modeling (BIM) purposes.
### **What you will learn**

- Loading an IFC file into a Python environment
- Retrieving specific elements (e.g., columns) from the model
- Accessing and calculating properties, such as total volume, of these elements
- Understanding how properties are stored in property sets

---

### **1. Set Up the Environment**
To begin, ensure that you have `ifcopenshell` installed in your Python environment. Then, import the necessary libraries in your script:

```python
import ifcopenshell
from pathlib import Path
```

- **ifcopenshell**: Provides tools to work with IFC files, allowing access to building model data.
- **Path (from pathlib)**: Offers a convenient way to handle file paths.

---

### **2. Load the IFC Model File**
We’ll start by loading the IFC file containing the building model.

```python
# Load the IFC file
model_path = Path(r"C:\Users\lilli\OneDrive\Desktop\DTU\Kandidat\OpenBIM\CES_BLD_24_06_STR.ifc")
if not model_path.is_file():
    raise FileNotFoundError(f"No file found at {model_path}!")

model = ifcopenshell.open(model_path)
```

- **model_path**: Converts the provided file path into a `Path` object, making it easy to verify and handle.
- **File Existence Check**: Checks if the specified file exists. If the file isn’t found, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised with a message indicating the missing file path.
- **ifcopenshell.open**: Opens the IFC model file using `ifcopenshell`, enabling extraction and analysis of data.

---

### **3. Retrieve Specific IFC Elements (Columns) from the Model**
IFC files classify building elements by type, so if we want to access all columns in the model, we can use `model.by_type("IfcColumn").` This retrieves all column elements, making it easy to analyze properties specific to columns.

```python
columns = model.by_type("IfcColumn")
```

- **columns**: Stores all instances of `IfcColumn`, allowing us to access each one individually.

---

### **4. Access and Sum Column Volumes**
IFC properties are often stored within *property sets* (`IfcPropertySet`). To access specific properties like volume, we need to navigate through these sets and locate the property by name.

Here’s how we can retrieve and sum the volume for each column element:

```python
# Initialize total volume for columns
total_volume = 0.0

for column in columns:
    volume = None  # Initialize volume as None in case it’s not found

    # Access all property sets associated with the column
    for definition in column.IsDefinedBy:
        if definition.is_a("IfcRelDefinesByProperties"):
            property_set = definition.RelatingPropertyDefinition

            # Check if the property set is of type IfcPropertySet
            if property_set.is_a("IfcPropertySet"):
                # Iterate through properties in the set
                for prop in property_set.HasProperties:
                    if prop.Name == "Volume":
                        # Get the volume value if available
                        volume = prop.NominalValue.wrappedValue if prop.NominalValue else None
                        break
            if volume is not None:
                break  # Exit if volume is found

    # Add the volume to the total if available
    if volume is not None:
        total_volume += volume

```
**Explanation**
- **IsDefinedBy**: This attribute links an element to its property definitions.
- **IfcRelDefinesByProperties**: Identifies relationships between elements and their properties.
- **IfcPropertySet**: Contains various properties (e.g., volume, area) associated with an element.
- **Volume Property**: Within `IfcPropertySet`, we look for a property named "Volume" and retrieve its value. If found, it’s added to the total volume.

---

### **5. Display Total Volume**
Finally, we can print the total volume of all columns in the model:
```python
print(f"Total volume of all columns: {total_volume:.2f} cubic meters")
```

This output provides the total volume of columns within the model, offering valuable insights into material quantities.

---

### **Example Output**
If the script successfully retrieves and sums the volumes for all columns, the output might look something like this:
```python
Total volume of all columns: 185.75 cubic meters

```

This indicates the total volume of all columns in the model, in cubic meters.

---

### **6. Further Steps**
After retrieving element properties, you might:

- **Classify Elements**: Group columns (or other elements) based on property values, such as their size or material type. For example, you could classify columns as "small" or "large" based on their dimensions or type.
This code systematically categorizes columns, calculates their volumes and total costs, and provides a summary, making it useful for analyzing column costs based on volume and type.
- **Calculate Costs**: Multiply the volume by the cost per cubic meter to estimate the cost of materials for the columns.
- **Analyze Specific Column Types**: You could modify the script to calculate the volume separately for different column types by categorizing columns based on their attributes (e.g., size or material).

---

### Conclusion
This guide demonstrates how to extract the volume property from columns in an IFC file using `ifcopenshell`. By understanding how to locate and access properties within `IfcPropertySet`, you can retrieve various data points from your IFC model, enabling deeper insights into your building’s structure and elements.

This method is adaptable to many other element types and properties, making it a versatile skill in BIM analysis. With these techniques, you can perform detailed analysis, generate estimates, and optimize resources in construction projects.

By categorizing columns into types and analyzing their properties further, you can enhance the accuracy of your building analysis and contribute to better-informed design and construction decisions.
